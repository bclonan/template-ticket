# Bento Box

Product Overview

# The Problems

---

Professionals are reluctant to adopt new technologies provided by their companies due to the time it takes for both training, installation and familiarizing oneself with the new platform.

Educating and onboarding employees on both the resources available to them, and the companies guidelines governing approaches towards various tasks is an ongoing battle, reducing consistency, and increasing the risk of human errors.

Interdepartmental communication and collaboration is often a barrier due to differences in vocabularies. 

# The Solution

---

## The `Bento Box` is an intelligent and fully customizable desktop first electron application that focuses on allowing corporations to define guidelines, enforce standardization, and reduce the risk of human error.

## The Core Focus

---

### Remove the barrier of new technology adoption through providing "behind the scene" software to software communication rather than asking employees to learn `which buttons do what`

### Simplicity through reducing the amount of `bells and whistles` and focusing on providing direct `role based` tools available to the company

### Allow employees to focus directly on their positions requirements and tasks , by providing intelligent `software to software` communication and data conversions.

### Reduce the risk of human error by reducing the number of checkpoints an employee must reach in accomplishing mundane repetitive `role based` tasks

### Ensure company consistency and style governance by preloading tools, and conversation points needed based on any given assignment

### Gain valuable analytics and recognize pain points amongst the organization.

### `Guide` and `gamify` the progress of completing various role based tasks governed and defined by departmental heads or industry professionals

the email contained a short paragraph welcoming Darb, a short overview of the companies history and a short synopsis of how to get started in his role by opening the `Bento Box` application and entering the attached `Bento Meal Ticket - ID` . Excited to get started, Darb quickly logs into his bento box with the company email and enters his `Bento Meal Ticket - ID` after a short and entertaining `loading` animation his `Bento Box` ui was automatically updated to reflect all of the tools, assignment automations, relevant company contacts, position hierarchy, a first assignment which advised him how to set up his environment. In the background the systems administrator who handles all of the licesing accounts for new ui/ux developers - engineers was notified within her bento box application with a new assignment with **Darb's** details, machine number and list of software licenses he would need, additionally darb's meal preferences and short bio was forwarded through a notification to his immediate coworkers. 

**Scenario 2** : Asked to Create an internal Dashboard Mockup

**Background** 

Darb begins his workday routine by setting down his coffee and taking out his
Laptop. After the screen turns on his `bento box` notifies him he has a new assignment through the tray chip, he clicks `view` and his assignment is named"creating a new dashboard". He navigates to the `workflow` tab, and begins typing the word  `dash..`

finds the "create a new dashboard" card and clicks the `start new` button which in turn creates and pushes a new card to the `On Deck` section of his bento box application.

## Sharron Westinghouse : Senior Partner

---

**Scenario 1** : Assigned with compiling report on an interdepartmental project

**Background** 

Sharron was tasked with creating a report detailing the progress of an ongoing company project. 

Sharron has been using tablue to view her charts and graphs for years now and wanted to compile the statistics between each department who was using different tools. The software development end of the department was microsoft azure, consisting of user stories, Kanban boards and more. The HR Office was using an custom made excel sheet to keep track of start dates, end dates, salaries, and employee ID's. The Legal department was using trello in order to keep track of compliance documentation needed for the software project. Each and every department was using their own version of the **`bento box`**  however, attached to each of the various role based tasks custom **company defined** analytics and metrics were attached, from there all Sharron had to do was open her bento box, begin her assignment and choose the data lake in which she wanted to tap into, as well as data points she was interested in. The final step was to choose her compile method which would immediately push all of her points into tablue.
