# Discovery - Brief mapping Mobile Web RFD

"process is a means to an end."

# Overall Goals

- - -

### What is the main objective we hope to accomplish by doing this project?

# Project Scope - Mobile/Web

- - -

## Basic

**Q ; What sort of deliverables would you expect upon completion?**

**Q ; What sort of timeline is available for this project?**

**Q ; Are there any additional project requirements that I may not have mentioned?**

**Q ; Would you be able to provide me with access to any analytics (google adwords/facebook/etc) on your current solution?**

* Useful to find out what screen sizes to design for
* useful for figuring out what platform/devices are most important to the end users
* useful to find out if you need to design for things like apple/ios

## Defining the problem

**Q : What’s the main problem we are trying to solve?**

**Q ; What Do You Want to Achieve with the Design?**

```
                    or
```

**Q: Can you tell me a bit about the problem you’re trying to solve with this project?**

## Key Performance Indicator (KPI)

**Q : What is your desired outcome?**

**Q ; What does `success` look like, and how will we measure it?**

## Accessibility

**Q ; Is Accessibility a requirement?** 

* IF YES : What level of accessibility is expected

## Understanding the `End User`

- - -

### Generalized

**Q ; Who is this product intended for?**

**Q ; Will the project need to support internalization ? (multiple languages)**

**Q ; How much time does the average user spend on the platform**

**Q ; Are there multiple ACL (Access-Control List) that the design needs to recognize? For example**

* A school super intendant has an area to hire/fire teachers
* a school teacher has a area to grade students
* a student has an area to receive their grades

### Skill levels

**Q ; How long has your company been using this tool or similar tools**

**Q ; How technically proficient is your average user**

**Q ; What degree level does your average end user hold**

### Industry

**Q ; What type of industry does the end user work in**

## Design Probing

- - -

### Figuring out what the client wants

**Q ; Is there any brand or style guides I should take into account when designing the project**

**Q ; Do you have any examples of finished/intermediary `end products` that I could draw inspiration from?**

**Q ; Is there any specific elements that stand out that you'd like to do differently?**

**Q: What Designs Do You Like? What designs dont you like?**

### Platforms/Frameworks

**Q ; On the development side has there been any decisions on using flexbox/grids/columns** 

**Q ; Is the project restricted to any specific style frameworks? For Example...**

* Bulma
* Tailwind
* Bootstrap
* Material Design

### Web Specific

**Q ;  Would the product have to support any legacy browsers ?** 

* Important question because certain elements and their functionality vary widely across browsers for example tables, and datepicker components

### Mobile Specific

**Q ; Which screen orientations should the design support?**

* Portrait
* Landscape
* Both

**Q ; Will you be using a cross platform development language (flutter/cordova/etc) or should I design separate UI's for each platform (IOS/Android/Windows Phone)**

## Deliverables

- - -

### Basic

**Q ; Are there any specific naming conventions the assets should folllow to help the developers? For example**

* asset_one.png - Good
* asset one.png - Bad **Space would break code**

**Q ; Do you have any examples of a set of finished deliverables I can work with as a reference**

### Imagery

**Q ; Are there any specific resolutions/extensions expected** 

* SVG
* Jpg
* png
* psd

**Q ; What level of compression do you want the assets**

### Videos

**Q ; Are there any length limitations for the videos**

### Documentation

**Q ; If styleguide : Does the styleguide need to be interactive? How involved should it be**
