title: User Stories 101 - 15 slides
---


1. What are user stories?

* User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature or functionality that a user would like to see in a product or application.
* They are written in a specific format: "As a \[user], I want \[goal/desire], so that \[benefit]"

2. How user stories fit into the software development lifecycle (SDLC)

* User stories are typically written at the beginning of the SDLC, in the requirements gathering phase.
* They help to ensure that the final product meets the needs of the users.

3. Complete example of a user story

| User                 | Goal/Desire          | Benefit                              |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Sales representative | Log in to my account | View and update my sales information |

4. Outline on how to create, use, and write user stories

* Identify the user and their needs
* Write the story in the format "As a \[user], I want \[goal/desire], so that \[benefit]"
* Prioritize and organize stories based on importance and dependencies
* Use user stories to guide development and QA processes

5. Jira-style templates for user stories

* Many project management tools, such as Jira, have built-in templates for creating and tracking user stories.
* These templates typically include fields for the user, goal, and benefit, as well as fields for acceptance criteria and other relevant information.

6. Scenarios and background information

* Scenarios are specific examples of how a user story might be used in the context of the product or application.
* For example, a login story might include scenarios for successful login, incorrect password, and account lockout.

7. End-to-end example project outline for a React-Native application for rewarding sales reps in a hotdog company named "Hotdog Bucks 4.0"

* The project would include user stories for logging in, resetting passwords, and updating account information.
* Additionally, there would be stories for viewing sales information, redeeming rewards, and receiving notifications of new rewards.
* The application would be built using React-Native, a framework for building mobile apps using JavaScript and React.

8. Structured "if/else/then" style stories

* This type of story format can be used for more complex or conditional functionality.
* For example:

| If                                           | Then                                  | Else        |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| Sales representative's account is locked out | Show message "Your account is locked" | Allow login |

9. User Story Acceptance Criteria

* Acceptance criteria are the specific conditions that a user story must meet in order to be considered complete.
* They should be written in a way that it is testable and measurable.
* Example:

| Criteria                         | Test                                   |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Login with correct credentials   | Login should redirect to the dashboard |
| Login with incorrect credentials | Error message should be displayed      |

10. User Story Estimations

* Estimations are the time and effort required to complete a user story.
* It can be done using different techniques like Planning Poker, T-Shirt Sizing, etc.
* Example:

| Story                      | Estimation |
|----------------------------|------------|
| Login                      | 2 days     |
| Reset Password             | 1 day      |
| Update account information | 3 days     |

11. User Story Tracking

* Tracking is the process of monitoring the progress of user stories.
* This can be done using tools like Jira, Trello, Asana, etc.
* Example:

| Story                      | Status      | Assigned to |
|----------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Login                      | In Progress | John        |
| Reset Password             | Completed   | Jane        |
| Update account information | Not started | Bob         |

12. User Story Prioritization

* Prioritization is the process of determining which user stories are most important to complete first.
* This can be done using techniques like MoSCoW, Kano Model, etc.
* Example:

| Story                      | Priority    |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| Login                      | Must have   |
| Reset Password             | Should have |
| Update account information | Could have  |

13. User Story Refinement

* Refinement is the process of breaking down user stories into smaller, more manageable chunks.
* This can be done using techniques like INVEST, SMART, etc.
* Example:

| Story                      | Refined                                                          |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Login                      | Allow login with email/password and social media                 |
| Reset Password             | Allow resetting password via email and phone                     |
| Update account information | Allow updating personal information, address, and payment method |

14. User Story Testing

* Testing is the process of verifying that a user story meets its acceptance criteria.
* This can be done using techniques like manual testing, automated testing, etc.
* Example:

| Story                      | Tested by | Result |
|----------------------------|-----------|--------|
| Login                      | John      | Passed |
| Reset Password             | Jane      | Passed |
| Update account information | Bob       | Failed |

15. Conclusion

* User stories are a powerful tool for agile development.
* They help to ensure that the final product meets the needs of the users.
* They provide a clear and concise understanding of what the end product should be, and how it should behave.
* They also help in gathering requirements and prioritizing them.
* Creating a user story is easy and it should be written in a simple language.
* User stories are also a powerful tool for collaboration between developers, QA, and product owners.
